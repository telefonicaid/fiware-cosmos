# <a name="top"></a>Cosmos Auth server
cosmos-auth exposes a RESTful API for [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) tokens generation. These tokens are used in other Cosmos RESTful APIs, such as [WebHDFS](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html) for authentication/authorization purposes.

In fact, tokens are not really generated by cosmos-auth, but by an Identity Manager (FIWARE's implementation is [Keyrock](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/identity-management-keyrock)) which is accessed by this API. So why not directly accessing the Identity Manager? This is because some sensible information regarding the Cosmos application is needed when requesting a token to the Identity Manager; specifically the `client_id` and `client_secret` generated once the Cosmos application is registered. Thus, in order this information continues being secret, it is necessary this kind of intermediary service.

[Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS) is used to provide communications security through asymetric cryptography (public/private encryption keys).

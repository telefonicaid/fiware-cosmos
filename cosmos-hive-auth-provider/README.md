# <a name="top"></a>OAuth2-based authentication provider for Cosmos
cosmos-hive-auth-provider is a custom authentication provider for [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/). Hive natively provides many ways of implementing authentication, e.g. [Kerberos, PAM or LDAP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Setting+Up+HiveServer2#SettingUpHiveServer2-Authentication/SecurityConfiguration), but it also allows for configuring custom mechanisms, like this one.

By using cosmos-hive-auth-provider users will be able to authenticate by means or their [OAuth2](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjOj8WZpszKAhXGtBoKHTCvBLMQFgggMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Foauth.net%2F2%2F&usg=AFQjCNG58oSRksGnoIWIhfWYBB1sg_YGng&sig2=9Sux2Pq4TJwspuoLrFoFrQ) token, generated by a OAuth2 Tokens Generator (a third party) handled by any trusted Identity Manager (for instance, [FIWARE Lab one](https://account.lab.fiware.org/)).

The advantage regarding the way this library has been implemented is that any user-and-password-based Hive client will continue working; simply, the password configuration parameter takes the token value.

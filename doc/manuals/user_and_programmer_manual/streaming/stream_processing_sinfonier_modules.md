##<a name="section1"></a>Module

Modules are pieces of code created by users and used by themselves in their topologies. First of all, modules must be validated by an administrator to ensure that your module is fit for publication, after that, you can make your contribution to the community and publish it.

Sinfonier supports three types of modules. Spouts and Bolts from Storm model, and includes Drains on topologies. Drains are just bolts responsible for handling information once processed in the topology.

Before you start to create modules on Sinfonier check you fulfill these requirements:

* Have a Github [http://github.com] account and know how to createa Gist.

* Have greats ideas and know how to implement them.

* Check the conditions of use.

##<a name="section2"></a>First Module


Creating a module consists of a simple two step process: Declare it and Ask for review. First you may declare your module. The process is as simple as:


* **Adding a name**
	* Be smart at this point, name is the first thing other users see
	* Use Java names convention
* **Select an entity**
	* Sinfonier uses it to classify your module
* **Select module type**
	* Spout, Bolt or Drain
	* Module type won't be changed
* **Choose language to be used**
	* Currently Sinfonier is able to work with Java and Python
	* If you are Python developer don't worry, although Apache Storm need some Java code when you are using Python Sinfonier create this code for you.
* Now it’s time to **refer your code**
	* Using a Gist
* Write a good **description**
	* Description helps other users to know your module features
* **Add fields** if needed
	* Fields are your inputs. Typical example is an API-Key param. 
	* See "Playing with Field" above to know more about that.
* Last but not least tell Sinfonier if you need additional **libraries**
	* You can check current libraries in Package section.

Every module is created in “developing” state. So… It’s time to code!

Your module has everything needed but one thing: The code. Sinfonier helps you offering a template based on module type, module name and module language. You only need to worry about the module functionality.

![Figure 1 - Sinfonier Template](images/sinfonier_python_template.png "Figure 1 - Sinfonier Template")

Use this template to create your Gist and then put the Gist URL into “Code URL” gap. Once you have your code ready you can request for validation and after that use it on your topologies. After your module has been validated you can choose to share it with other users publishing it, just changing it to the "public" state.

**Understanding module states (GC)**

Maybe this could be the most complicated concept in Sinfonier.

**Playing with fields**

Fields are parameters that users have to fill for using modules. Developers must get this data using "getParam" method (Java lang.). Typical use could be get an API-Key to be used on a “bolt” to get data from an authenticated external service, or just a simple filter need on a "Spout".

TIP: Use a human-readable text on "Label" and developing style text on "Name".

**Updating a module**

Did you improve your module? Just update your Gist code and notify us using "Update source code" button on edit module page.

**Delete a module**

It is possible to delete a module for the owner of a module by clicking the "Delete" button in the detail of the module.Be aware that if you delete it, it will not be available at your “My tools” list anymore, however, it will remain functional enought in your already implemented topologies.

###<a name="section2.1"></a>States of the module


* **Developing:**
	* This is the first state of the modules just after its creation. At this point, the module can only be seen by the owner. It is possible to change the code until the validation request is sent. After sending this request, pending is the next state of the module.
* **Pending:**
	* This is the after state to the creation and developing of a module. At this point, the module has to be validated by an administrator. The administrator has two possibilities, if the module is correct and the administrator considers it proper, it will be validated and the next state of the module will be private. If not, the module will be sent back again to the developing status.
* **Private:**
	* When a module is at this state, it can only be seen by the owner of the module and can be used to implement new topologies by the user. If the user wants, the module can be published passing it to the published status.
* **Published:**
	* This state is very similar to the private state, with the difference that at this point everybody can use this   module to implement his new topologies. The owner of the module can switch between the private and published state whenever he wants. If the owner of the module changes the code of it at published or private state, it will need validation, so it will go again to the pending status.
* **Deleted:**
	* This is a point of non return, when a module is deleted it is not going to be available anymore, however, it could be used by the topologies already implemented. Only the owner of a module can delete it.


Frequently asked question

* **I deleted a module but It’s been on my topology**
	* After a module has been deleted users (included module owner) can’t use it for implementing new topologies, however already implemented topologies can still make use it.

##<a name="section3"></a>Development environment

In order to make easier develop and test modules Sinfonier Team, using code developed by Gaspar Muñoz, is creating a virtual machine that includes all you need to create new modules and create unit test before you upload your modules to Sinfonier.

* Just download .ova file.
	* [Sinfonier Dev. Environment Virtual Machine](https://goo.gl/owpyr4)
* Import in your VirtualBox Software.
* Run virtual machine
* Use “sinfonier” to login password
* Start creating modules using Eclipse

Eclipse include sinfonier-dev-tool as a project created from Github repository. 

[Tool to build modules for Sinfonier project.](https://github.com/sinfonier-project/sinfonier-dev-tool)

Eclipse include all plugins needed to edit python files, use maven repositories and work with Github.

![Figure 3 - Sinfonier Virtual Machine Eclipse](images/sinfonier_dev_module_template_vm.png "Figure 3 - Sinfonier Virtual Machine Eclipse")

If your module, Spout, Bolt or Drain needs an external library you can add it using Maven dependecies manager included in Eclipse.

Eclipse show you your current dependencies:

![Figure 4 - Sinfonier Virtual Machine Dependecies 1](images/sinfonier_dev_module_dependencies_add_1.png "Figure 4 - Sinfonier Virtual Machine Dependecies 1")

And allow you to add new one using a simple form:

![Figure 5 - Sinfonier Virtual Machine Dependecies 2](images/sinfonier_dev_module_dependencies_add_2.png "Figure 5 - Sinfonier Virtual Machine Dependecies 2")

However you can search dependencies in [Maven Repository](http://mvnrepository.com/) and add them directly into pom.xml file.


##<a name="section4"></a>Creating a Java Module

Once you have your virtual machine up and running and Eclipse is started. Select the package where you want to add new modules and create a *new java class*.

![Figure 6 - Sinfonier Module Create Class](images/sinfonier_dev_module_creating_new_class.png "Figure 6 - Sinfonier Module Create Class")

Your superclass should be one of BaseSinfonierBolt, BaseSinfonierSpout or BaseSinfonierDrain from com.sinfonier.* package.

Using browser option type first words from class names and select superclass.

![Figure 7 - Sinfonier Module Create SuperClass](images/sinfonier_dev_module_creating_new_class_superclass.png "Figure 7 - Sinfonier Module Create SuperClass")

As a result Eclipse creates a new class with al methods to be rewritten and Sinfonier MIT license. Ready to start working with...

Once your module (bolts in our examples) is ready to be tested it’s time to write your unit test and ensure our code works as expected.

	import com.sinfonier.utils.ComponentType;
	import com.sinfonier.utils.Runner;
	import org.junit.Assert;
	import org.junit.Before;
	import org.junit.Test;

	import java.util.Map;

	public class TestYourBolt {

	    @Before
	    public void setUp() {
	    }


	    @Test
	    public void testYourBolt() {
	        // Instantiate your module
	        Map<String, Object> result = Runner.run(ComponentType.BOLT, YourClassName.class,0);

	        // Code the test conditions
	        Assert.assertNotNull(result.get("result"));
	        Assert.assertEquals(4, Integer.parseInt(result.get("result").toString()));
	    }
	}

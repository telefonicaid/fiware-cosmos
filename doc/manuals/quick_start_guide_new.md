## <a name="section1"></a>Introduction
This Quick Start Guide overviews the steps a newbie programmer will have to perform in order to get familiar with Cosmos and its functionality. For a more detailed information, please refer to the official [documentation](http://fiware-cosmos.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and the Cosmos entry in the [FI-WARE Catalogue](http://catalogue.fi-ware.org/enablers/bigdata-analysis-cosmos).

## <a name="section2"></a>Assumptions
This Quick Start Guide assumes you are going to use the already deployed Global Instance of Cosmos in FIWARE Lab. This is the <b>recommended usage of Cosmos</b>. This global instance runs in a cluster of machines, providing distributed storage (based on Hadoop Distributed File System - HDFS) and distributed computing capabilities (based on Hadoop MapReduce engine and some querying tools such as Hive).

In fact, the Global Instance of Cosmos in FIWARE Lab is not really a single Hadoop cluster, but one cluster in charge of storage governed by the <i>Storage Endpoint</i> (`storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org`) and another one in charge of computing governed by the <i>Computing Endpoint</i> (`computing.cosmos.lab.fiware.org`).

## <a name="section3"></a>Step by step guide
### <a name="section3.1"></a>Step 1: Get an OAuth2 token
All APIs in FIWARE Lab are protected by means of [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) tokens. Cosmos is not an exception, so you will need to request to the <i>Computing Endpoint</i> a valid token for your FIWARE Lab user. `curl` tool can be used for that purpose:

    $ curl -k -X POST "https://computing.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:13000/cosmos-auth/v1/token" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "grant_type=password&username=<YOUR_USER_EMAIL>&password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>”

Where `username` and `password` are the email and password you used when you registered in FIWARE Lab. You should get something like:

    {"access_token": "3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 3600, "refresh_token": "V2Wlk7aFCnElKlW9BOmRzGhBtqgR2z"}

The `access_token` field is the OAuth2 token.

### <a name="section3.2"></a>Step 2: Create a Cosmos account
At the moment of writing, deploying a Cosmos Portal for FIWARE Lab is in the roadmap, but not yet done.

Thus, in order to create an account you will have to send an email to `francisco.romerobueno@telefonica.com` specifying your FIWARE Lab ID.

Such an ID can be obtained by querying FIWARE Lab's Identity Manager:

    $ curl -X GET "https://account.lab.fiware.org/user?access_token=<YOUR_OAUTH2_TOKEN>"

The result of such a query for the user `frb` is:

    {"organizations": [], "displayName": "frb", "roles": [{"name": "provider", "id": "106"}], "app_id": “9556cc76154361b3b43d7b31f0600982", "email": "frb@tid.es", "id": "frb”}

The interesting part is the "id" field, in the above example `frb`.

### <a name="section3.3"></a>Step 3: Upload some data to HDFS
You can upload your own data to your HDFS space using the WebHDFS RESTful API listening on TCP/14000 port of the <i>Storage Endpoint</i>.

Let's start by creating a new directory (`testdir`) in our HDFS user space (in this example, `hdfs:///user/frb`). `curl` has been used as REST client:

    $ curl -X PUT "http://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testdir?op=MKDIRS&user.name=frb" -H "X-Auth-token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00" | python -m json.tool
    {"boolean": true}

Now, it is time to upload some local file (`testdata.txt`) to the fresh new directory we have created (please observe the verbose option `-v` has been used):

```
$ cat testdata.txt
luke,tatooine,jedi,25
leia,alderaan,politician,25
solo,corellia,pilot,32
yoda,dagobah,jedi,275
vader,tatooine,sith,50
```

```
$ curl -v -X PUT -T testdata.txt "http://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testdir/testdata.txt?op=CREATE&user.name=frb" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -H "X-Auth-token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"
*   Trying 195.235.93.174...
* Connected to storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org (195.235.93.174) port 14000 (#0)

```

The above command just has started the uploading operation. As can be seen, the WebHDFS service redirects us to the following location:

    location: http://dev-fiwr-svc-01.tid.es:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testdir/testdata.txt?op=CREATE&user.name=frb&data=true

That's because the first operation only created the new `hdfs:///user/testdir/testdata.txt` HDFS file in the Namenode; not it is time to upload the data bytes to the Datanodes, and that's achieved by PUTting again the local `testdata.txt` file in the redirection URL:

```
$ curl -v -X PUT -T testdata.txt "http://dev-fiwr-svc-01.tid.es:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testdir/testdata.txt?op=CREATE&user.name=frb&data=true" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -H "X-Auth-token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"

We can check the data has been successfully uploaded:

```
$ curl -X GET "http://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testdir/testdata.txt?op=OPEN&user.name=frb" -H "X-Auth-token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"

NOTES:

* `dev-fiwr-svc-01.tid.es` is just an alias of `storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org`.
* You can get more details on the 2-step uploading operation in the [WebHDFS specification](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html).
* The Global Instance of Cosmos in FIWARE Lab runs the [HttpFS gateway](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-hdfs-httpfs/index.html). That's why the REST operations are done against the TCP/14000 port and not the against the TCP/50070 port used by WebHDFS (which is not exposed). That's also the reason the redirection locations point to the HttpFS server itself instead of to the real Datanode.

### <a name="section3.4"></a>Step 4: Query your data
Coming soon.

### <a name="section3.5"></a>Step 5: Run your first MapReduce job
Several already developed MapReduce examples can be found in every Hadoop distribution, typically in a Java `.jar` file called `hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar`. This file is copied to the HDFS space a user owns in FIWARE Lab, specifically under the `jars/` folder, so the `frb` user should have it copied to:

    hdfs:///user/frb/jars/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar

Thus, you can run the <i>Word Count</i> example (this is also know as the "hello world" of Hadoop) by typing:

```
$ curl -X POST "http://computing.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:12000/tidoop/v1/user/frb/jobs" -d '{"jar":"jars/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar","class_name":"wordcount","args":["hdfs://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org/user/frb/testdir","hdfs://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org/user/frb/testoutput"]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"
{"success":"true","job_id": "job_1460639183882_0001"}
```

As you can see, another REST API has been used, in this case the Tidoop REST API in the <i>Computing Endpoint</i>. The API allows you checking the status of the job as well:

```
$ curl -X GET "http://computing.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:12000/tidoop/v1/user/frb/jobs/job_1460639183882_0001" -H "X-Auth-Token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"
{"success":"true","job":{"job_id":"job_1460639183882_0001","state":"SUCCEEDED","start_time":"1461060258427","user_id":"frb","stderr":"...","stdout":"..."}}
```

### <a name="section3.6"></a>Step 6: Download some data
Finally, the result of the MapReduce execution can be seen at the output HDFS folder (which is automatically created) by using the WebHDFS REST API in the <i>Storage Endpoint</i>:

```
$ curl -X GET "http://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testoutput?op=liststatus&user.name=frb" -H "X-Auth-Token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"
{"FileStatuses":{"FileStatus":[{"pathSuffix":"_SUCCESS","type":"FILE","length":0,"owner":"frb","group":"frb","permission":"644","accessTime":1461060272601,"modificationTime":1461060272616,"blockSize":134217728,"replication":3},{"pathSuffix":"part-r-00000","type":"FILE","length":47,"owner":"frb","group":"frb","permission":"644","accessTime":1461060272228,"modificationTime":1461060272409,"blockSize":134217728,"replication":3}]}}
$ curl -X GET "http://storage.cosmos.lab.fiware.org:14000/webhdfs/v1/user/frb/testoutput/part-r-00000?op=open&user.name=frb" -o output.txt -H "X-Auth-Token: 3azH09G1PdaGmgBNODLOtxy52f5a00"
$ cat output.txt
